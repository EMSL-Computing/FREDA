The FTICR R Exploratory Data Analysis (FREDA) tool is designed to allow users upload and explore data generated from FTICR mass spectrometry. Current capabilities include:

* Upload data from .csv file  
* Assign samples to named groups
* Calculate values associated with observed compounds (e.g. Kendrick Mass, NOSC)
* Filter the compounds based on mass, number of times observed, presence of molecular formulae, or custom filters
* Remove individual samples
* Create Van Krevelen, Kendrick, and density plots for:  
  * single samples
  * multiple samples
  * comparisons of two groups of samples
* Download a preprocessing summary report, .csv data summaries, and plots in .pdf .tiff and .png formats

***

#### **Recent Updates:**

  * *Groups Tab:  Combine samples into named groups*
  * *Remove samples in the filter tab*
