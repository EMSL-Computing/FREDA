The FTICR R Exploratory Data Analysis (FREDA) tool is designed to allow users upload and explore data generated from FTICR mass spectrometry. Current capabilities include:

* Upload data  
* Calculate values associated with observed compounds (e.g. Kendrick Mass, NOSC)
* Filter the compounds based on mass, number of times observed, presence of molecular formulae, or custom filters  
* Create Van Krevelen, Kendrick, and density plots for:  
  * single samples
  * multiple samples
  * comparisons of two groups of samples
* Download plots .pdf .tiff and .png formats

***

#### **Recent Updates:**

  * *Groups Tab:  group uploaded samples into named groups*
  * *HTML report generation*
  * *Calculate compound classes in preprocessing step*
