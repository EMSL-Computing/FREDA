# Welcome to FREDA

***

The FT-MS R Exploratory Data Analysis (FREDA) tool is designed to allow users upload and explore data generated from Fourier transform (FT) mass spectrometry (MS) instruments. Current capabilities include:

* Upload data from .csv file  
* Assign samples to named groups
* Calculate values associated with observed compounds (e.g. Kendrick Mass, elemental ratios e.g. O:C)
* Filter the compounds based on mass, number of times observed, presence of molecular formulae, or custom filters
* Remove individual samples
* Create van Krevelen, Kendrick, density, custom scatter, and principal coordinate plots for:  
  * single samples
  * multiple samples
  * comparison of two samples
  * comparisons of two groups of samples
* Download a preprocessing summary report, .csv data summaries, and plots in .pdf .jpeg and .png formats

***

#### **Recent Updates:**

  * *Linked plots sub-tab of the Visualize tab.  Interactively compare scatter or single sample histogram plots.*
  * *Map peaks to values in the Kegg and Metacyc databases.*
